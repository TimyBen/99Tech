API Service Module Documentation
Introduction
This module provides an API service for updating user scores on a scoreboard. It ensures real-time updates and prevents unauthorized score increases to maintain data integrity and security.

Flow of Execution

1. User Action: When a user performs an action on the website, triggering a score increase.

2.  Dispatch API Call: Upon completion of the action, the website dispatches an API call to the backend application server with the user's information and the updated score.

3. Authorization Check: The backend server verifies the user's authorization to increase the score. Unauthorized requests are rejected.

4. Update Score: If the user is authorized, the backend server updates the user's score on the scoreboard.

5. Real-time Update: The scoreboard is updated in real-time to reflect the changes made by the user.

Additional Comments
Ensure that the API endpoints are secured with appropriate authentication mechanisms such as JWT tokens or OAuth to prevent unauthorized access.
Implement rate limiting and request throttling to mitigate potential abuse or spamming of the API.
Log all API requests and responses for auditing purposes and troubleshooting.
Consider implementing caching mechanisms to improve performance, especially for frequently accessed data like scoreboard information.
Provide comprehensive error handling and informative error messages to assist clients in troubleshooting issues.
Consider implementing validation checks on user input to prevent injection attacks and ensure data integrity.
Regularly review and update the API documentation to keep it accurate and up-to-date with any changes or new features.
